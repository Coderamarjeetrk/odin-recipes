    <h1>Ingredients (Serves 4)</h1>
    <h2>For the Filling:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100g dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher)
</li>
<li>100g unsalted butter (plus extra for greasing)
</li>
<li>2 whole eggs
</li>
<li>2 egg yolks
</li>
<li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
</li>        
<li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour
</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract
</li>
<li>Pinch of salt
</li>
    </ul>

     <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ul>
        Step 1: Prep Your Ramekins
<li>Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F).
</li>
<li>Grease four ramekins with butter and lightly dust with cocoa powder to prevent sticking.
</li>
Step 2: Melt Chocolate & Butter
<li>In a heatproof bowl, melt chocolate and butter together over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) or microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring in between.
</li>
<li>Let the mixture cool slightly.
</li>
Step 3: Beat Eggs & Sugar
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, and sugar until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).
</li>
Step 4: Combine & Fold
<li>Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture.
</li>
<li>Add vanilla extract, salt, and flour. Fold until just combined. Do not overmix.
</li>
Step 5: Fill & Bake
<li>Pour the batter evenly into the ramekins.
</li>
<li>Bake for 11–12 minutes until the edges are set but the center is still soft. Don’t overbake—you want that molten core!
</li>
Step 6: Serve
<li>Let rest for 1 minute, then gently run a knife around the edges and invert onto serving plates.
</li>
<li>Serve immediately with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or fresh berries.
</li>
</ul>
